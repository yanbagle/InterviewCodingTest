Hi There! 

I've completed the project as a Node/Angular application. 

To run:

1.) In cmd or terminal, cd to where the server.js file is.

2.) Run the command "node server.js"

3.) In a web browser, go to http://localhost:8080/

The application is able to show transactions without donuts transaction and without CC payments. 

Have fun and thank you for your time!
